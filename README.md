## SYSTEM DESIGN
Design is the first step in the development phase for any techniques and principles for the 
purpose of defining a device, a process or system in sufficient detail to permit its physical 
realization. Once the software requirements have been analysed and specified the software 
design involves three technical activities - design, coding, implementation and testing that are 
required to build and verify the software.
